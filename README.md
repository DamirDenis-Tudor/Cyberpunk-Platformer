# 1. Game Docker Container<a name="release"></a>
##TODO : OPTIMIZE THE CONTAINER BUILD
## Description
This Docker container provides a Debian-based environment with the latest version of the game sourced from GitHub. It comes with all the necessary libraries and dependencies preinstalled. The container is configured to have access to the X11 TCP protocol, enabling the game window to be displayed on your machine.

## Availability
This Docker container is available for the following operating systems:
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Fedora
- CentOS

## Docker Image
The Docker image for this container is hosted on DockerHub. It is automatically updated whenever a commit is made to the GitHub repository, ensuring that the container always reflects the latest version of the game.

## CI/CD with Jenkins
This setup utilizes a local server running Jenkins, which is also a Docker container based on Ubuntu. Here's an overview of the CI/CD pipeline process:
1. When triggered, Jenkins clones the GitHub repository containing the game source code.
2. Jenkins then executes a bash script that updates the game image from DockerHub.
3. This ensures that the game image within the Docker container is always up to date with the latest changes from the GitHub repository.

## Install
- #### Download the 'setup' folder and make the scrips executables : 
```shell
  chmod 777 docker.sh
  chmod 777 cyberpunk.sh
```
- #### Run the script that installs the docker on your linux distribution :
``` shell
  ./docker.sh --install    
```
- #### Now it's time to download the newest game container : 
```shell
  ./cyberpunk.sh --pull
```
- #### If you want to restart the game run :
```shell
  ./cyberpunk.sh --start
```
- #### If you want to delete the container and its image run :
```shell
  ./cyberpunk.sh --delete
```

## Uninstall 
```shell
  ./docker.sh --uninstall
```


# 2. Architecture<a name="architecture"></a>
- #### The project is based on two behavioral design patterns: State and Mediator.
- #### Additionally, Singleton and Flyweight are used as needed.

### 1. Game interfaces : StaticComponent, Interactive, Notifiable, Serializable
- StaticComponent: allows implementing a frame by frame-modifiable and drawable component.
- Interactive: allows interacting with an Object.
- Notifiable: allows receiving a Message(Sender,Message,SenderId).
- Serializable: built-in in java and allows an object to be serialized.(transientâ€”specifies which fields are ignored)
  <br></br>
### 2. State & Mediator
- The SceneHandler class is designed to manage multiple scenes, allowing it to activate or deactivate scenes based on incoming requests.
- Additionally, by implementing the Notifiable interface, it is capable of notifying a specific scene when changes are made in another scene.
  <br></br>
- The Scene abstract class not only implements the Notifiable interface but also serves as a mediator between its associated StaticComponents.
- The Scene class is extended by subclasses such as PlayScene, LevelPauseScene, MainMenuScene, LoadScene, and so on. Each of these subclasses has different types of components.
- For example, menu-related scenes will have Button and TextComponents, while PlayScene will have a series of DynamicComponents.
  <br></br>
- The DynamicComponent class is an abstract class that implements the Notifiable, Interactive and Serializable interfaces and is extended by classes such as Player, Enemy, GameMap, Gun, Bullet, Platform, Helicopter, and Chest.
- In the PlayScene, when a component is added, it needs to be upcasted to StaticComponent. When the component needs to be notified or to interact with an object, it needs to be downcasted to DynamicComponent.
- Here is an UML diagram with the structure described :

# 4. Details<a name="details"></a>
- The game loads its assets via an XML (tmx) file generated by a Tiled app, which is parsed using DomParser. The extracted assets are then organized into the AssetsStorage class, including animations, images, positions, and more.
- The game also uses a series of enum classes such as MessageType, ComponentType, AnimationsType, and others, and has a dedicated Timer package with a Timer class and a TimerHandler to handle the created timers.
- Additionally, the game has a Utils package that includes Coordinate, Rectangle, Pair, Constants, and RandomIdGenerator classes, and dedicated classes for Window, Camera, and Input.
- The game database has a Saves table containing a text reference to a series of Save tables and a timestamp. Each Save table has an auto-increment ID to maintain order, a component type ID, and a BLOB field.

| Saves | Save |
